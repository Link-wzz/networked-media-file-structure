    <p>Foreword: The "Memory Drink" website is designed to show my personal photography work in an unusual way. Since I have a little basic knowledge 
        of HTML and CSS, I boldly attempted to create more than a traditional personal website. This website took me 2 days (about 15 hours) to build, and the
         process was very challenging because, before this, I knew nothing about js. Through Google and YouTube I learned some basic skills and applied 
         them to this site. Therefore, the js used on this website is very inefficient. I used js in a very 
         dumb way as a rookie. However, I will continue to update its code as I begin to master the js. </p>
    <p>
        Also, Sam, if you are reading this, 80% of my motivation for creating this website comes from the amazing inspiration website that you listed in the requirements. I viewed these super cool websites and then 
        I really want to make one, also since I already have some basics of html/css, I would be unhappy with myself if I still using the knowledge that I knew, that is why I kind of challenge my self
        for a little bit in this project. Overall, thank you for the great instructions and examples, this try really broadened my understanding of what web can be.
    </p>

    <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>When I came up with this website, I wanted to show some of my photography. When I was thinking about mediums that could carry photos, the first thing that came to my mind was Lotte Koala's March Bite Sized Cookies, 
        a kind of snack I used to eat as a kid, which was basically a chocolate chip cookie in the shape of a cute koala. The reason why I thought of this snack is that every time you buy a box of these biscuits, 
        you can tear off a small piece of paper at the bottom of the biscuit box, about 1.5*2inch in size, and there is a cute photo of a koala on the small pieces of paper, you can collect these photos, and you can also put them together 
        to form a koala family photo. 
        <br/>
        <img src="image/Cookie.png" width="400px">
        <br/>
        <p>
            So I thought I could make a mechanism to buy cookies and put my photograph in it as gift. But the cookie box was a bit hard to distribute, so then I thought of a vending machine:
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img src="image/machine.png" width="300px">
    <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>
            Vending machine is a great medium, it can distribute different kinds of drinks, and it is relatively easy to make cartoon shapes. Therefore the final website would be about a Vending machine that offers free drinks, and with each drink, 
            the user can receive a postcard of my photography. After deciding the theme, I used figma to draw the vending Machine and the drinks in it:
            <br/>
            <img src="image/VMFigma.png" width="1000px">
            <br/>
            <img src="image/figma01.png" width="1000px">
        </p>

        <p>
            Then I bring all the stuff to the PS and use it to make shadow effects. I also made the note ui in the PS
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img src="image/ps.png" width="1000px">
        <p>
            Then, when all the visual icons are done, I start to put the things together in HTML and CSS. The coding process is not much to say, I keep trying the code and then looking for ways to debug.

            I also used www.w3schools.com to review some basics about html and css, also java.

    <h1>Questions</h1>
        The responsive design is hard for me. I spent sometime to figure out how to make the web work on 27inches monitor and laptop. However, I still having trouble making the mobile version. 
    </br>
        <p>Also, I was originally going to make the postcard random showup, but it was too difficult, so I have to give up.  </p>
