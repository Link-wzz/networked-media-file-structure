    <!-- Hi Sam, I use inline css for the documentation page html tag because I think such simple css does not need to be linked externally... 
        I know that you said "NEVER USE INLINE CSS!" in class, but I think it is okey for documentation page...right? Hope you don't mind :) -->

    <h1>Hand Clock Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Inspiration and concept</h2>
    <div>
        <a href="https://www.notion.so/Networked-Media-Project-2-Concept-1067511643b080c0b6b7e8f4d91132a0"> 
        Here is the link to the initial concept 
        </a>
    </div>
    </br>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <div>First of all, I removed the background of 0-9 gesture and export them as png images</div>
    <div>
        <img src="images/doc01.png" style="width: 50vw">
    </div>
</br>

    <div style="width:60vw">I finished the UI design in figma. To be honest, I was a little dissatisfied with the height of the hand on the page because the length of 
        the arm was not enough to reach the center of the pc screen, so if I wanted to create the impression that the arm was sticking out from the edge of the screen, I had to place the image at the bottom of the screen.
        Also, to make the time transition to be very smooth, I didn't switch images directly. Instead I let the hands slide out from the bottom of the screen, then the new hand slowly rise up.
        On the left side of the image below is another page layout idea I thought of at first, that is to use a graphs to increase the distance between the hand and the edge of the screen,
        however such graphics make the page look less concise, also diminishes people's attention to the hand, I wanted the background to be as simple as possible, so that it would be easier 
        for the user to concentrate on watching the hand change.

    </div>
</br>
    <div sytle="width:60vw">
        Next up is programming. Since my last project didn't adapt well to different screens, I was very careful this time. I used Flexbox and responsive layouts like vw and vh to make sure the web page was compatible with various screens. 
        In fact, I even programmed the compatibility of mobile phones, and therefore this web page display perfectly on most mobile phones.

        <div>Last time when we did the peer review on project1, Patrick told me that I can add shadows directly to png image, and this time I took his advice and used the auto-generated shadows on the graphics of my hands, THANK YOU PATRICK!!!!</div>
